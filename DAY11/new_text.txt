I'll **** on you, da-da, da-da, da-da
I'll **** on you, da-da, da-da, da-da
I'll **** on you, da-da, da-da, da-da
I'll **** on you (Haha), I will **** on you
I'll **** on you, girl you know
I'll **** on you, ***** or man
I'll **** on you, I will **** on you (Swifty McVay)
I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin' bombs on the back of record companies (Uh-huh)
Blow 'em up if they ain't wantin' me
The National Guards, they scared of huntin' me
I love beef; I got you hoes duckin' me
A drug thief, *****, I'll take your marijuana
These slugs'll keep your ass away from my corner
I drown ****** in hundred degree saunas
You can act if fool if ya wanna (*****)
This is lyrical piranha, strapped with a grenade in the pool with yo mama
Attack her by the legs (Uh-huh), then I pull her to the bottom (Yeah)
Swift's nuttin' up like a condom, slappin' if you ****ers got a problem
When I see 'em (Uh-huh), you hoes ending up in a ****in' mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM (*****)
Pull in the garage while you screamin' (Uh-huh)
Keep the motor on then I'm leavin', I'll **** on you
I will **** on you I don't care who you are (I'll **** on you)
I don't give a **** about you or your car (I'll **** on you)
**** your house, **** your jewellery and **** your watch (I'll **** on you)
**** your wife, **** your kids, **** your family (I'll **** on you)
I'm an alcoholic, where's the ****ing toilet?
Pass the hot dog (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
*****, shut your ****ing mouth, I'ma keep eatin' 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house with a chainsaw to cut me out (My house, my house)
I'll **** your wife; I had *** since I met her
Too busy ****ing a twelve-year-old babysitter (Hehehe)
And all women ain't ****
Only good for cookin', cleanin', and suckin' dick, and that's it (I said it)
I'm responsible for killin' John Candy
Got JonBenet Ramsey in my '98 Camry (She's lost)
I don't give a **** who you are
I'll **** on anybody; truly yours, The Idiotic Bizarre
My adolescent years weren't **** to what I do now
I never grew up, I was born grown and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the **** I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is I fit in
Ignoring the **** how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit, I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit (Nope)
I know I'm a bit flaky, but they make me
It's they who egged me and say they can take me (Come on)
It's they who legs I break and make achy
'Cause they who mistake me make me so angry (Ugh)
(I'll **** on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissin' and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin', I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon bleu and
Straight **** like Notorious B.I.G. did to that *****
On his skit on his last album, pull my pants down, I'll **** on you
