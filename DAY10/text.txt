I'll shit on you, da-da, da-da, da-da
I'll shit on you, da-da, da-da, da-da
I'll shit on you, da-da, da-da, da-da
I'll shit on you (Haha), I will shit on you
I'll shit on you, girl you know
I'll shit on you, bitch or man
I'll shit on you, I will shit on you (Swifty McVay)
I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin' bombs on the back of record companies (Uh-huh)
Blow 'em up if they ain't wantin' me
The National Guards, they scared of huntin' me
I love beef; I got you hoes duckin' me
A drug thief, bitch, I'll take your marijuana
These slugs'll keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act if fool if ya wanna (Bitch)
This is lyrical piranha, strapped with a grenade in the pool with yo mama
Attack her by the legs (Uh-huh), then I pull her to the bottom (Yeah)
Swift's nuttin' up like a condom, slappin' if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em (Uh-huh), you hoes ending up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM (Bitch)
Pull in the garage while you screamin' (Uh-huh)
Keep the motor on then I'm leavin', I'll shit on you
I will shit on you I don't care who you are (I'll shit on you)
I don't give a fuck about you or your car (I'll shit on you)
Fuck your house, fuck your jewellery and fuck your watch (I'll shit on you)
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family (I'll shit on you)
I'm an alcoholic, where's the fucking toilet?
Pass the hot dog (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
Bitch, shut your fucking mouth, I'ma keep eatin' 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house with a chainsaw to cut me out (My house, my house)
I'll fuck your wife; I had sex since I met her
Too busy fucking a twelve-year-old babysitter (Hehehe)
And all women ain't shit
Only good for cookin', cleanin', and suckin' dick, and that's it (I said it)
I'm responsible for killin' John Candy
Got JonBenet Ramsey in my '98 Camry (She's lost)
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours, The Idiotic Bizarre
My adolescent years weren't shit to what I do now
I never grew up, I was born grown and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is I fit in
Ignoring the shit how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit, I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit (Nope)
I know I'm a bit flaky, but they make me
It's they who egged me and say they can take me (Come on)
It's they who legs I break and make achy
'Cause they who mistake me make me so angry (Ugh)
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissin' and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin', I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon bleu and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album, pull my pants down, I'll shit on you
